    "text": "Course description\nIn this seminar, students are introduced to working with digital behavioral data (DBD). DBD refer to digital traces of human behavior that are knowingly or unknowingly left in online environments (e.g.¬†social media, messengers, entertainment media, or digital collaboration tools). These rich data are increasingly available to social scientific research in the public interest, but can also be used to derive strategic insights for business decisions.\nStudents learn how to work with DBD alongside the entire research process‚Äîfrom data collection, preprocessing and analysis, to reporting and provision (e.g.¬†via open science tools). Students first get a comprehensive overview of the ways in which DBD can be collected (e.g., API scraping, usage logging, mock-up virtual environments, or data donations), as well as the requirements for data protection, research ethics, and data quality. Afterwards, students apply their newly acquired knowledge in small projects on use cases from media and communication research. In doing so, they learn important computer-based methods with which large digital behavioral data sets (e.g.¬†texts, images, usage behavior logs) can be processed and analyzed. By completing this module, participants will get an up-to-date overview and practical insights into how the potential of observational data (digital traces) can be used to better understand the behavior of media users in digital environments.\n\nFocus of the current course\nThe seminar in the winter term 2025/26 focuses on the empirical study of outdoor advertising in public spaces‚Äîfrom systematic documentation to content-related and data-based analysis. Participants will develop and test their own research designs to document advertising formats and motives, and explore potential effects. Various methodological approaches can be combined: in addition to designing a short survey instrument (e.g., in the form of an experience sampling design), the seminar involves documenting and describing advertising media (image or text documentation) and analyzing the collected data.\nDepending on their research focus, implementation, and data availability, participants may choose quantitative or qualitative approaches‚Äîranging from (visual) content analysis and survey data analysis to geospatial data use. The seminar provides the necessary theoretical foundations and introduces methodological tools such as R or Python.",

My role as the instructor is to introduce new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to apply and explore them. Much of your work in this course will involve creating questionnaires, testing survey tools, and writing code.\nAs coding is a skill that is best learned by doing, you are expected to bring a laptop to the sessions were we are ‚Äúlive-coding‚Äù so that you can take part in the in-session exercises.

Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\nPolicy on use of generative artificial intelligence (AI):\nYou should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course1: (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate‚Äîrather than hinder‚Äîlearning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n‚úÖ AI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n‚ùå AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.",

The expected group size is 2-4 persons.\nThe following list contains an overview of the assignments to be completed in the course:\n\n\nBreakdown of the final grade\n\n\nAssignment\n100 Pts.\n\n\n\n\nüë• Written assignment: Research Project Sketch\n30 Pts.\n\n\nüë§ Peer Review: Research Project Sketch\n20 Pts.\n\n\nüë§ Participation: Pre-Test\n20 Pts.\n\n\nüë• Written assignment: Research Report\n30 Pts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionImportant Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\nThe final structure of the course (e.g.¬†which and how many small projects) will be discussed and determined together with the students in the first session. Accordingly, it is possible that the portfolio or the assignments it contains may be adjusted accordingly (e.g., the scope, content, or deadlines could change, or entire assignments might be omitted).",

    "text": "üë• Write Research Project Sketch (40 Pts.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantTL;DR\n\n\n\n\n‚úçÔ∏è Task: Write a Research Project Sketch (including short Questionaire Sketch) as a group.\nüìÇ Submission format: PDF document (1,000 to 1,500 words, not including Abstract & Appendix with questionaire sketch)\nüí° Evaluation: Based on theoretical grounding, methodological clarity, and survey design quality.\nüë• Group size: 2-3 persons\nüìÖ Deadline: 18.12.2025, 23:59\nüí¨ Feedback option: You can book one individual feedback session (max. 30 minutes) in the last two weeks of November.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the Research Project Sketch is, for each group, to establish a solid foundation for a (potential) future implementation of the research project and to prepare for the block sessions in January. Based on the provided literature, each group is expected to design a research project that could be conducted as a (pretest) survey within the seminar.\nPlease choose the method, survey design, and topic according to your group‚Äôs interests and experience. Be selective about what you include: the aim is to write a cohesive and well-structured narrative that demonstrates a comprehensive and coherent (methodological) project plan, rather than a fundamental theoretical elaboration of the topic. The overall length of the written report should be between 1,000 and 1,500 words per group (excluding abstract & appendix).\nEach group may book one individual feedback session (max. 30 minutes) during the last two weeks of November. In the session, you can discuss your ideas, ask questions about the assignment, and receive feedback on your draft. Not all group members need to attend, but at least one representative should be present. The feedback session can be held in person or via Zoom.\n\n\n\nIntegration of a (Short) Questionaire Sketch\nAs an important part of your project sketch, please include a Questionnaire Sketch that specifies and operationalizes the central aspects of your research project. The questionnaire should take the form of a short survey consisting of no more than six questions or queries (e.g., image upload), designed to be completed within 1-2 minutes. You do not need to implement the survey technically; a written description is sufficient. Focus on using existing validated scales or items from the literature where possible.\nThe purpose of the questionnaire is to collect the key data required to answer your research question. Focus exclusively on the essential aspects of your study (e.g., exclude demographic questions). Attach the complete questionnaire as an appendix to your written report. It does not count toward the 1,500-word limit of the project sketch.\nPlease provide complete details of your survey design, including: - the exact wording of all questions, - the response options, - any relevant scales or measurements, and - appropriate citations for established items or scales, if applicable.\n\n\nRecommended structure and components\n\nTitle and Abstract\n\nWorking title of the project\nShort summary (about 100 to 200 words):\n\nWhat is the project about?\nWhat is its goal?\nWhat methods will be used?\nWhy is it relevant?\n\n\n\n\nTheoretical Background and Problem Statement:\n\nOverview of the research field, current debates, and why the topic matters\nKey theoretical concept(s) and/or model(s), and their relation to existing literature\nTheoretical and empirical background motivating the study\nClear research questions anchored in theory, with expected implications (and, if possible, explicit testable assumptions or hypotheses)\n\n\n\nMethodological Approach\n\nResearch design (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods)\nData basis (e.g., text corpus, interviews, surveys, experiments)\nAnalytical methods (e.g., content analysis, multilevel analysis, (visual) topic modeling, etc.)\nBrief outline of the workflow (data collection, processing, analysis, interpretation)\n\n\n\nQuestionaire Sketch\n\nDesign a short survey (max. 6 questions/items and 1-2 minutes) to collect key data for your project.\nFocus on the core aspects needed to answer your research question (exclude demographics).\nProvide complete details on question wording, response options, and any relevant scales or measures.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria\nThe quality of the Research Project Sketch will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\n\n\nTotal\n30 Pts.\n\n\n\n\nTheoretic Background and Problem Statement\n5 Pts.\n\n\nMethodological Approach\n10 Pts.\n\n\nShort-Survey Design\n10 Pts.\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\n5 Pts.",

Each student will therefore be assigned one other group‚Äôs Research Project Sketch to review before the first block session. The goal is to briefly summarize the content of the report, evaluate its strengths and weaknesses, and provide constructive suggestions for improvement. Please complete the peer review form based on your reading of the assigned group‚Äôs Research Project Sketch. Your review should be thorough, constructive, and respectful. Focus on providing actionable feedback that can help the group improve their project. This will allow you to receive additional feedback before starting the practical work on your research project.\nDuring the peer review process (20.12.2025 until 05.01.2025), you will be provided with\n\nread-only access to one group‚Äôs Written Report Sketch, and\na link to a digital peer review form. The form contains both short item scales and open-ended questions.\n\nThe completed peer review forms will be shared with the respective groups before the first block session in January.\n\nEvaluation Criteria\nThe peer review will be graded on the extent to which it comprehensively and constructively addresses the components of the other group‚Äôs report: research context and motivation, proposed methodological and analytical approach, and short-survey design. In particular, the depth, coherence and constructiveness of your feedback will be evaluated.",

The goal is to create a ‚Äúmaster‚Äù short survey that integrates elements from all group questionnaires. Several test runs may be necessary to ensure quality and functionality.\nThe pretest serves two main purposes: 1. Testing functionality, clarity, and effectiveness: The pretest allows students to test their developed questionnaire in a realistic environment, identify potential problems, and make improvements. 2. Generating preliminary data: Initial data can be used for exploratory analysis, helping students assess the feasibility of their research and analytical design and draw first conclusions.\nParticipation in the pretest is mandatory for all students. Further details‚Äîsuch as the exact procedure, schedule, and mode of participation‚Äîwill be communicated in due time before the pretest.",
